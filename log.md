# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on HTML structure of Tribute Page, changed some of the CSS, did a course on git and watched a tutorial on how to create repo's on github, push and pull content unto Github through using the terminal.

**Thoughts:** Getting the HTML structure I want is proving trick but made a lot of progress but need to work on CSS a bit more to get the page looking more fluid. Really enjoyed learning to use git on the terminal and picked up the git commands really quickly. Github at first seemed confusing but watched a tutorial on youtube which was pretty handy [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE)

### Day 2: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Tribute page a bit more and finally publicly shared it on the freeCodeCamp Facebook group. Went through some Javascript material covering loops, Arrays and Objects.

**Thoughts:** Was very apprehensive about sharing my work on Facebook but the response seems very good so far and receptive. Need to carry out more pratical examples on loops to deepen my understanding.

### Day 3: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Managed to clear a number of exercises on freeCodeCamp in the JQuery section and work more on loops in Javascript.

**Thoughts:** Defintely made a lot of progress today on Loops as the concept is becoming more clearer, the cloud of confusion has finally lifted.
