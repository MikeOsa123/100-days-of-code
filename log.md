# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on HTML structure of Tribute Page, changed some of the CSS, did a course on git and watched a tutorial on how to create repo's on github, push and pull content unto Github through using the terminal.

**Thoughts:** Getting the HTML structure I want is proving trick but made a lot of progress but need to work on CSS a bit more to get the page looking more fluid. Really enjoyed learning to use git on the terminal and picked up the git commands really quickly. Github at first seemed confusing but watched a tutorial on youtube which was pretty handy [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE)
